	//Precondition: You must have an array to store tags in, a const int value to represent the maximum
		//number of tags you would like to input, a const int value for the minimum number of tags
		//and the user must input a value for "tag input number" that is greater than MIN_TAGS and
		//less than or equal to MAX_TAGS. The user must then input tags corresponding to the 
		//tagInputNumber. These tags may not have any characters not allowed in a file name by 
		//the Windows OS.
	//Postcondition: Each of the stored tags will be written, line by line, to a text file tagsText.txt
		//for storage and manipulation. The array will be populated with the tags from this text
		//file upon running the program again.

	//Precondition: A string, inputTag, will be put into this function which will then write it to a text file.
	//Postcondition: There will be a text file populated with the input strings.
