//Description: Eventually, this program will take an input "tag" and find files corresponding to said tag, and then automatically file those for the user.
//Last Changed: February 16, 2019



/* Current I have removed all code regarding use of fstream - the file i/o and such. Now, tags will be stored directly 
into an array and the data will be manipulated directly from that array instead of reading and writing from a text file.
Thus, I have completely rewritted the program from the ground up, using switch to create a menu and sortingArray to store the tags.
